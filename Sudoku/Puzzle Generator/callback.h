 I noticed the generator was always returning the same puzzle,
 in the C program, random() is called. When I jump to that definition I see:
 long     random(void) __swift_unavailable("Use arc4random instead.");
 
 In searching this function, it appears to be a Swift function unavailable in C. So I need to
 call a swift function that will return a random value so my generator will work.
 
 I am using this stack overflow OP's solution, as no one provided them with a better method
 and I didn't find a different solution elsewhere.
